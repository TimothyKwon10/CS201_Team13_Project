                    <p> Nestled within USC Village, our new dining hall compliments the vision of the university’s 
                        residential college experience which combines living, learning and community to 2,500 students. 
                        USC Village is one of the largest developments in South LA history. The new dining hall is visually 
                        impressive – collegiate gothic architecture, high ceilings, dramatic lighting and beautiful stained-glass 
                        windows accent the 8,000-square foot space with seating for over 400 guests. <br><br>

                        Chef Nathan Martinez has created an equally impressive menu to support the USC Hospitality 
                        Food Philosophy, featuring a wide variety of dining options including USC’s first ever 100% 
                        self-contained plant-based station (vegan friendly). Other stations include a full salad, sandwich 
                        and soup bar, dessert station featuring made to order sweet and savory crepes and hand scooped ice cream. <br><br>
                        
                        Each residential community is anchored by an all-you-care to eat dining venue. Specific meal plan 
                        participants enjoy unlimited access to all three dining halls. Each offers a different culinary 
                        experience appealing to a variety of dining preferences and nutritional lifestyles of our diverse 
                        student population.</p>
